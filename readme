This project is used for Low-Power HLS design. There are some features:
    
    1. generate CRG automatically.
        - clock mux (BUFGCE_MUX)
            e.g., 
                  #pragma HLS clkdomain clk1 10 5 3 1
                  #pragma HLS clksel clk1 sel
                This means the module following belongs to clock domain "clk1", and this clock
                has four frequency, 10ns, 5ns, 3ns, 1ns. The signal used to select different 
                frequency is "sel"
    
        - PLL/MMCM/BUFGCE_DIV selection automatically
            e.g., 
                  #pragma HLS clkdomain clk_src 10
                  void top(){
                    #pragma HLS clkdomain clk1 20
                    module_1();
                    #pragma HLS clkdomain clk2 15
                    module_2();
                  };
                In this example, "clk_src" is connected to clock pin. Since the frequency of "clk1"
                is 1/2 of "clk_src", the BUFGCE_DIV is used to generate it. For "clk2", PLL is used.
                If there are more than 2 clock domains generated from the same source clock, a MMCM 
                will be generated since a PLL can only generated 2 output clock while a MMCM supports
                7 output clock ports.
            
        - clock gate (BUFGCE)
            e.g.,
                  #pragma HLS clkdomain clk1 15
                  #pragma HLS clken clk1 cen
                This means the module following belongs to clock domain "clk1" whose frequency is 
                15 ns. Besides, it can be gated by BUFGCE with a enable signal called "cen"

        - rst_sync
            Reset for each clock domain will be generated automatically.

    2. generate CDC circuit automatically according to INTERFACE type.
        
        - The CDC circuit selection depends on the INTERFACE type. Currently, we only support stream
          (FIFO interface), AXI, Double Buffer because they can cover most of the cases.
        
        - Insert CDC circuit to top modules generated by VITIS HLS

    3. generate XDC file automatically
